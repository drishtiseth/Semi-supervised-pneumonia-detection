Semi-supervised Pneumonia Detection:
This project explores a semi-supervised learning pipeline for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It combines **SimCLRv2 self-supervised pretraining** with **supervised fine-tuning** and **knowledge distillation**, using both labeled and unlabeled datasets.
